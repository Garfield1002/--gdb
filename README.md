Feel free to leave some feedback or contribute to this project.

Micro gdb is a minimalist gdb frontent inspired by microcoruption's interface.

## ðŸ§ª Technologies

Micro gdb is built using a flask server with a React applicaton.

The flask server relies heavily on [pygdbmi](https://github.com/cs01/pygdbmi).

## âš™ Usage

Install requirements with

```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

You can then start the server by running

```bash
python3 ./server/ hello.c
```

The server can be started with either a C file or a binary.

Micro gdb will then be accessible at [http://127.0.0.1:5000/](http://127.0.0.1:5000/)

## ðŸ›£ Roadmap

As mentioned earlier, micro gdb is in an early stage of development. I am  currently working on implementing various features

- Support for the IO terminal for interacting with the inferior

- Better terminal outputs (there is currently a bug where the terminal can get "stuck" in the middle of an output)

- Editable fields for the registers as well as the memory

- Suppot for cross compilation and RiscV (I need this for a school project)
